  <h1>Car Black Box Project</h1>

  <p>This project involves porting a traditional car black box system to the NodeMCU (ESP8266). It captures essential driving data — such as speed, acceleration, and braking events — and stores them in non-volatile EEPROM using I2C communication. An LCD and matrix keypad enable basic interaction and data retrieval.</p>

  <h2>Original Architecture</h2>
  <p>The system was originally built using the PIC18F4580 microcontroller. Data from various sensors was recorded and displayed via peripherals, using low-level C code and direct register manipulation.</p>

  <h2>Porting to NodeMCU</h2>
  <p>The core logic is now ported to the NodeMCU (ESP8266), preserving all features but adding wireless monitoring. The firmware is written in bare-metal C (no RTOS), and interacts with EEPROM, LCD, and keypad using GPIOs and I2C.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This port modernizes the original black box using Wi-Fi-enabled hardware while retaining low-level control. It demonstrates real-world use of microcontroller peripherals and embedded data logging techniques.</p>
